# dotNETANPR

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bolorundurowb/dotNETANPR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bolorundurowb/dotNETANPR)

This is a work in progress. I am converting the java code in javaanpr into c# which would make the library usable by .NET programmers. I have finished some classes, but I'll need help in some classes that haven't been converted and in some of the converted classes, i might have missed a few things. Please feel free to fork the project and make adequate corrections.

This project aims to port [this](https://github.com/oskopek/javaanpr) library from Java to .NET. Big ups to [oskopek](https://github.com/oskopek) for the original java library.
