# dotNETANPR

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bolorundurowb/dotNETANPR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bolorundurowb/dotNETANPR)

This is a work in progress. I am converting the java code in javaanpr into C# which would make the library usable by .NET developers. I have finished porting all the non-GUI functionality but I am yet to convert the GUI (will do that soon). I am currently moving into testing to see how well the library does with recognizing characters and to pick out bugs.

Contibutions are very welcome.

This project aims to port [this](https://github.com/oskopek/javaanpr) library from Java to .NET. Big ups to [Ondrej Martinsky](http://javaanpr.sourceforge.net/) for the original `javaanpr` library.
