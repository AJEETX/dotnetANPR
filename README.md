# dotNETANPR
This is a work in progress. I am converting the java code in javaanpr into c# which would make the library usable by .NET programmers. I have finished some classes, but I'll need help in some classes that haven't been converted and in some of the converted classes, i might have missed a few things. Please feel free to fork the project and make adequate corrections
